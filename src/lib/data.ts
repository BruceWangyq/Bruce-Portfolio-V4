    bio: `Hi, I'm Bruce! 

I began my web development journey 2 years ago and have committed myself to learning front end and web3 technologies.

I have considerable experience with nextjs, typescript, and postgres, which has become my stack of choice for most web apps.

I also have considerable experience with solidity and rust and have developed dozens of smart contracts for ethereum/solana.

I was born in China and moved to the Canada when I was pursuing my master degree of mechanical engineering. Because of this I am fluent in both Mandarin and English.
